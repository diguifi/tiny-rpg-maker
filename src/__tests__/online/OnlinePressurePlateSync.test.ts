/**
 * Reproduces a production bug reported in online mode:
 *
 *   "The guest pulls the lever (switch); it really toggles and both clients see
 *    the change. BUT on the guest the lever does not influence the pressure
 *    plate, while on the host it does."
 *
 * A pressure plate's visual/active state is driven by `isVariableOn(variableId)`
 * (see RendererEntityRenderer). A switch wired to that same variable therefore
 * "influences" the plate by toggling the variable.
 *
 * Pressure plates are meant to be HOST-AUTHORITATIVE: the host evaluates every
 * player's position and broadcasts the resulting variable, and the guest only
 * mirrors it (see itemTypes.ts PRESSURE_PLATE comment, and the `guestMode` guard
 * inside InteractionManager.handleSwitch).
 *
 * The bug: InteractionManager.checkPressurePlates() is NOT guarded by guestMode,
 * so the guest re-evaluates pressure plates locally from its own position only.
 * When the guest moves off a plate it writes `setVariableValue(var, false)`,
 * clobbering the value the host had set via the lever. Because the broadcaster
 * only emits diffs and the host's value never changed, the host never re-syncs
 * the variable — leaving the guest permanently out of sync.
